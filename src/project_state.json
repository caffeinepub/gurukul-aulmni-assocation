  "architectural_notes": [
    "Add role-based access control (RBAC) beyond a single admin list; define roles/permissions for content (posts/announcements) and member management actions.",
    "Introduce an approval state for members and enforce it during authentication/authorization so unapproved users cannot access the app.",
    "Add support for user-uploaded profile pictures (storage, URLs, privacy: visible to all) with a placeholder fallback.",
    "Add data model + admin CRUD for Executive Committee entries, including historical/past committees.",
    "Add content models/pages for Gallery and Acts & Activities (likely admin-managed).",
    "Provide admin-managed content models + CRUD UI for Gallery items and Acts & Activities entries (not just static pages).",
    "Add an admin-only \"Backend\" diagnostics page; define what backend information is safe to expose and ensure it is protected by RBAC/super-admin access.",
    "Support a bootstrap/super-admin mechanism (e.g., hardcoded or config-based allowlist) to always grant admin privileges to a specific email identity (chresthaxakxham@gmail.com), in addition to existing admin management.",
    "Backend page should read from persistent canister state (database-like tables) for any backend info that must be stored long-term, not only computed at request time.",
    "Backend/data page table UI should support CRUD operations (add/edit/delete) plus client-side or server-side search/filter, sorting, and pagination for large datasets; must remain responsive and admin-only."
