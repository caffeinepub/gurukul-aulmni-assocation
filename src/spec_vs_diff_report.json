  "summary": "Frontend pages (/gallery, /activities) and Admin Dashboard UI panels/dialogs for managing Gallery and Activities were added/updated, and a migration module plus new backend state/types were introduced. However, the diff summary does not provide explicit evidence that the backend exposes the required admin-only CRUD and approved-member list/query APIs with the specified authorization/trap behavior.",

      "id": "REQ-30",
      "requirement": "Backend exposes admin-only methods to create, update, and delete Gallery items and Acts & Activities items; and approved-member (or admin) query methods to list them, enforcing the same access rules and clear unauthorized trap messages.",
      "reason": "The provided backend/main.mo excerpt shows new types (GalleryImage, Activity), storage maps, and ID counters, but no visible public methods for list/create/update/delete or their authorization/trap logic. Because the diff is truncated, the required APIs cannot be confirmed from the evidence shown.",
